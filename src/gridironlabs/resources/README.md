Packaged assets that ship with the app:

- `theme.qss` — starter dark theme aligned to OOTP-inspired layout (includes styling for panel cards, settings controls, and optional panels like the League Leaders widget). It sticks to the house palette (amber accent, neutral dark panels) instead of recreating external mock colors; add new selectors here rather than hardcoding widget styles in Python.
- Future icons, fonts, and media assets belong here.
