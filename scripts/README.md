Operational utilities:

- `refresh_data.py` — orchestrates pulls from nflreadpy/PFR into Parquet.
- `generate_fake_nfl_data.py` — builds synthetic rosters/stats so UI features (like the League Leaders grid) have data when you are offline.
- Future generators (synthetic data) and maintenance tasks belong here.
