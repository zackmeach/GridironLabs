# docs

Documentation starters:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — high-level flow and layering.
- `DATA_DICTIONARY.md` — schema fields, units, and versions.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — expectations for collaborators and tooling.
- UI layout notes (including the static Settings mock) live alongside code in `src/gridironlabs/ui/README.md`.
